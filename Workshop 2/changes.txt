After recieving peer reviews from other students we have decided to make the following changes:

"No members with the same name can be added":
Instead of saving the members as 'FirstName_LastName.txt" we will save it as "uniqueID.txt".
That means we can have members with the same name.

"No input validation at all, resulting in crashes":
We decided to fix this by using try/catch that handles string inputs when the program expects an integer.

"We miss units (for input) for boats and error messages":
We added units and error messages.
