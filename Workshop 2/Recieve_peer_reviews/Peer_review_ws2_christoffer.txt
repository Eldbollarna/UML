Notes on UML Java Workshop 2 Jesper Holmstrom There isn't much I can complain on in the code. I'm really not sure how this workshop is intended to work. If we are doing a MVC workshop then this code is not using a controller and as such must implement a real controller for it to be correct. Since we aren't doing MVVM things then I must assume that it is doing something incorrect.

Class Diagram: Lists the different classes but uses filled arrows. This should mean association, but what does it represent in the class diagram? Since it doesn't tell what the association is there is something missing, though you could derive it from the diagram since they list the fields. Since there are few classes there isn't much going on, but at least there should be some form of association or dependency that isn't modelled.

Sequence diagram: The sequence diagrams seems to be doing the right thing, but they are not doing it completely right. I'm not quite sure what the Client is since it first wants to do the different commands and then it doesn't recieve anything? For example the View member diagram. The client wants to view something, and provides a unique id. After that the Console prints member information, but the client doesn't recieve anything? Of course the Client maybe doesn't recieve anything if you want to model the Console as the view and the view is doing the displaying, but then the client maybe shouldn't be the one doing the controlling. That diagram (View member) also is doing "for register.getMembers get m with uniqueID", shouldn't that be something that the Console is checking with a differnet class such as the Registry? If so, why is it only the Client and the Console in the diagram?

The code did not come with instructions for how to run the code but I asked for them and they provided them so it wasn't that big of a problem.
